     * Dart callback function, as registered by the Dart side of the android_alarm_manager plugin.
     * However, there may be asynchronous gaps between [onReceive] and the eventual invocation
     * of the Dart callback because [AlarmService] may need to spin up a Flutter execution
     * context before the callback can be invoked.
