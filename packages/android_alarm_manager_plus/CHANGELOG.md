    to false, the alarm will not survive a device reboot.
  - Requires AndroidManifest.xml to be updated to include the following
    entries:

    ```xml
    <!--Within the application tag body-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>

    <!--Within the manifest tag body-->
    <receiver
        android:name="io.flutter.plugins.androidalarmmanager.RebootBroadcastReceiver"
        android:enabled="false">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"></action>
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>

    ```

## 0.4.0

- **Breaking change**. Migrated the underlying AlarmService to utilize a
  BroadcastReceiver with a JobIntentService instead of a Service to handle
  processing of alarms. This requires AndroidManifest.xml to be updated to
  include the following entries:

  ```xml
        <service
            android:name="io.flutter.plugins.androidalarmmanager.AlarmService"
            android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"
            android:exported="false"/>
        <receiver
            android:name="io.flutter.plugins.androidalarmmanager.AlarmBroadcastReceiver"
            android:exported="false"/>
  ```

- Fixed issue where background service was not starting due to background
  execution restrictions on Android 8+ (see [issue
  #26846](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/26846)).
- Fixed issue where alarm events were ignored when the background isolate was
  still initializing. Alarm events are now queued if the background isolate has
  not completed initializing and are processed once initialization is complete.

## 0.3.0

- **Breaking change**. Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support
  Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it
  requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also
  migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're
  using the original support library.

## 0.2.3

- Move firebase_auth from a dependency to a dev_dependency.

## 0.2.2

## 0.1.0

- **Breaking change**. Set SDK constraints to match the Flutter beta release.

## 0.0.5

- Simplified and upgraded Android project template to Android SDK 27.
- Moved Android package to io.flutter.plugins.

## 0.0.4

- **Breaking change**. Upgraded to Gradle 4.1 and Android Studio Gradle plugin
  3.0.1. Older Flutter projects need to upgrade their Gradle setup as well in
  order to use this version of the plugin. Instructions can be found
  [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Updating-Flutter-projects-to-Gradle-4.1-and-Android-Studio-Gradle-plugin-3.0.1).

## 0.0.3

  demonstrates overriding the Application's onCreate method so that the
  AlarmService can initialize plugin connections.
