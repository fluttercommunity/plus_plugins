## Battery Plus Overview

Battery plus 🔋 is a Flutter plugin that helps you get information about the current state of the device battery on which the app is running on, for instance, the percentage of the battery and charging status.

:::note
Battery plus is going to replace the [original Battery plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/battery), 
if you have been using it, it's better to switch to this one.
